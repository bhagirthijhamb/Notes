Overall architecture of app. How all of the components and technologies are going to communicate
- When a user navigates in the browser to our domain say Emaily.com,  we are gonna send them back a html document (index.html) and some JS filesa that contain a React application. These files will make some content appear on the screen. This is going to be the React side of our application
The React side of our application does not know what to show to the user. It needs some data to show lie a list of srverys/ campains. We will use MongoDB to record and store al the different surveys and emails that we will send to people over time.
Express API will have a bunch of business logic ns will be in between React and MOngoDB.
It will take incoming request orm React app, pulll info form MongoDB  and send to back to React
SO the user visits Emaily.com website in the browser -> We send them the React app -> React aspplication boots up -> asks the Express API for some data -> Express API pulls some infor from MongoDB -> sends it to the React app -> React app show that on the screen tto the user
